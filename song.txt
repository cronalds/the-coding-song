The coding Song!


I'm a polyglot, there ain't a single programming language that I ain't got!
Low level, high level, I don't care, I can interpret anything with just a stare!

HTML & CSS, PHP & mySQL
These are the tools of a web dev.
Node.js is the best the end!
Browser are amazing Chrome and FireFox and Safari!
